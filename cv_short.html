Raffaella Bernardi is Associate Professor at the Faculty of Engineering, Free University of Bozen-BOLZANO (UNIBZ) since April 2025. Previously, she was Associate Professor at CIMeC
(Center for Mind/Brain Science) and DISI
   (Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science), University of Trento. From 2002 till
2010, she has been assistant professor with a temporary contract at the
Faculty of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano where
she taught Computational Linguistics and acted as local coordinator of
the Erasmus Mundus European Masters Programme in LCT. She studied at
the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam specializing in Logic and
Language, in 1999 she joined the international PhD Programme at the
University of Utrecht and wrote a dissertation on categorial type
logic (defended in June 2002). Since then she has continued to
contribute extensively to this field by organizing several
  international workshops, summer schools and being part of Organizing Committees, Programme Committees, and Management Boards of international scientific events; she has also been quite active in disseminating the topic by means of
teaching activities. After her PhD defence, she has worked within the
Network of Excellence in Computational Logic (CoLogNET) for the area
Logic and Natural Language Processing and she has been part of the
Management Board of FoLLI (European Association for Logic, Language
and Information) for several years. Furthermore, she has done joint work  with
the University of Bologna, the University of Pisa, the University of
Amsterdam, INRIA Loraine, the University of Utrecht, the Australia
University and New York University, carrying out work on Corpora,
Grammar Induction within the Categorial Grammar framework, Question
Answering and Categorial Type Logic. Her research interests took a
computational turn in October 2002 when she moved to the Free
University of Bozen-Bolzano and started working on Natural Language
Interfaces to Structured Data. In 2011, she has started working on
Distributional Semantics investigating its compositional properties
and its integration with Computer Vision models.  She has supervised
PhD projects on controlled natural language to access ontology and
databases and on Interactive Question Answering Systems in the Library
																				     Domain. She is now mostly working on Multimodal Models in interactive settings (e.g. visual dialogues). She has been for long the local coordinator of the
Erasmus Mundus European Masters Programme in LCT and of the Language
and Multimodal Interaction track of the MSc in Cognitive Science
																				     offered by the University of Trento, she is now CIMeC Teaching Delegate. She is the author of more than 100
publications in proceedings of international workshops, conferences
and journals. She has been the PI within the EU Project "CACAO" (CP
								 2006 DILI 510035 CACAO Program: eContentplus), she has been member of the unitn team for the EU projects "Galateas" (CIP-ICT-PSP-2009-3 250430), LiMoSINe (FP7-PEOPLE 214905), CogNET (ICT-14-2014 RIA). She has been part of
the team which won the ERC 2011 Starting Independent Research Grant
COMPOSES (project nr. 283554). She has been member of the Management
Board of the Cost Action The European Network on Integrating Vision
     and Language and she is part of the Executive Board for the Special Interest Group on Computational Semantics (SIGSem) and for Formal Grammar.
																				     She has recently been the EU representative within the ACL Sponsorship Board, and she ELLIS elected Fellow.
